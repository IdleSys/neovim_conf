# Nvim dotfile

## Plugins:

- tpope/vim-sleuth:

This plugin automatically adjusts 'shiftwidth' and 'expandtab' heuristically based on the current file, or, in the case the current file is new, blank, or otherwise insufficient, by looking at other files of the same type in the current and parent directories.

- lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim:

Super fast git decorations implemented purely in Lua.

- folke/which-key.nvim

WhichKey helps you remember your Neovim keymaps, by showing available keybindings in a popup as you type.

- folke/lazydev.nvim

is a plugin that properly configures LuaLS(Lua language server) for editing your Neovim config by lazily updating your workspace libraries.


- Bilal2453/luvit-meta

This project is a collection of definition files for the framework Luvit. The definitions provide types for all modules currently shipped in Luvit, the classes, methods and their arguments and returns; it does as well provide descriptions whereever possible, either by scraping the Luvit-docs, Nodejs docs, luv docs or manually written in some places.

- neovim/nvim-lspconfig

nvim-lspconfig is a "data only" repo, providing basic, default Nvim LSP client configurations for various LSP servers.
